# Answers to questions from "Genomic Variant Files"

Q1: What are the different line types and how are they designaged in a VCF file?

A: VCF files contain meta-information lines prefixed with '##', a header line prefixed with '#', and data lines each containing information about a position in the genome and genotype information on samples for each position (with the text fields separated by tabs).

Q1: How many positions are found in this region in the VCF file?
A: 105

Q2: How many samples are included in the VCF file?
A: 90

Q3: How many positions are there total in the VCF file?
A: 3489

Q4: How many positions are there with AC=1?
A:1075

Q5: What is the ratio of transitions to transversions (ts/tv) in this file?
A:3.47

Q6: What is the median number of variants per sample in this data set?
